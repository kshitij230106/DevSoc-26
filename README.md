🚨 Sign SOS – Real-Time AI Emergency Assistance System

Sign SOS is an AI-powered emergency communication platform developed during a 48-hour hackathon to assist deaf and mute individuals in critical situations. The system uses real-time hand gesture recognition with MediaPipe to interpret sign language and convert it into automated emergency alerts.

The application features a computer vision-based gesture detection module integrated with a Flask REST API to process machine learning predictions efficiently. It captures live user location using the Geolocation API and automatically shares emergency messages via WhatsApp along with a Google Maps location link, ensuring quick and accurate response.

By combining artificial intelligence, full-stack development, and real-time location services, Sign SOS provides an inclusive, fast, and practical solution to bridge communication barriers during emergencies.
